Instalation of TrEd
===================

This text describes installation of tred under Linux or any other
UN*X-like system.


REQUIRES
--------
  perl >=5.8   (at least 5.8.5 recommended for various reasons)
  perl/Tk ver. >= 804

INSTALLATION
------------

Untar the distribution tarball using the following command:

	tar -xzf tred-current.tgz 

A distribution directory named tred will be created.

In this directory you will find among others the following files and
directories:

	README              (a readme file)
	INSTALL             (this file)
	tred                (the program itself)
	tredlib/            (other files necessary for running tred)
	tredlib/tredrc      (configuration file)


You may try to issue ./tred in this directory.


If you prefer having executable files in a different directory than
the libraries (tredlib), you may follow the instructions below.

INSTALLING TO SEPARATE DIRECTORIES
----------------------------------

You may wish to move the whole tredlib/ directory to a location of
your choice, move tred files to some
directory in your PATH and make a copy of tredrc named .tredrc in your
home directory. To ensure that tred finds its lib-directory tredlib
you may either set TREDHOME environment variable to the location of
tredlib or edit your .tredrc and add a line similar to the following:

LibDir  = "/my/favoured/location/for/tredlib"


CUSTOMIZING TrEd
----------------

TrEd reads and uses a configuration file and macro-file (where user
may define his/her own macros (in Perl) and bind them easily to
keystrokes or menus). TrEd searches for the configuration file in in
your home directory and also the directory from which it was
started. To customize tred, you may wish to make a copy of the
configuration file "tredrc" shipped with the distribution in your home
directory. This copy must be named ".tredrc" (note the dot at the
beginning). If you want TrEd to read your own set of macro (instead
the default sample set "tredlib/tred.mac"), you should point to it by
the option "macroFile" in your ".tredrc" like this:

macroFile = "/my/favoured/macro.set"
