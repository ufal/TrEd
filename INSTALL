Installation of TrEd
====================

This text describes manual installation of tred under Linux or any
other UNIX-like system. For Windows, an installation package can be
download from the project home-page (http://pajas.matfyz.cz/tred).

REQUIREMENTS
------------

Perl >=5.8   (at least 5.8.5 recommended for various reasons)

TrEd further requires the following Perl modules and their
dependencies:

File-Temp
File-Spec
Text-Iconv
Tie-IxHash
Tk            (for GUI)
Compress-Zlib (for printing to PDF)
XML-LibXML    (for various I/O backends)
XML-Simple
XML-Writer

All the above modules are bundled in a package tred-dep-unix.tar.gz
which can be fetched from the project homepage. This bundle also
contains an install script which installs all the packages. If you
want, you may also install these modules from CPAN.

INSTALLATION
------------

1) install all dependencies (see above).

2) unpack the distribution package, e.g. with

   tar xzvf tred-current.tar.gz

  (as you read this README, it is likely you have already done so).

3) copy the resulting tred directory to a suitable locatoin on your
system, e.g. with

  cp -R tred /opt
or 
  cp -R tred $HOME/

4) Create symlinks to tred, btred, and ntred executables from the
destination directory you have chosen to some directory in your path,
e.g.

  ln -s /opt/tred/*tred /usr/local/bin 

5) Check your installation with: 

  tred -v

You should obtain output like:

  TrEd Id: tred,v 1.337 2005/04/13 18:17:08 pajas Exp
  Perl: 5.008005
  Platform: linux
  Tk: 804.027
