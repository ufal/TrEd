Instalation of tkdisplaytree.pl aka tkfs ver. 0.2
=================================================

This text describes installation of tkfs under Linux or any other
UN*X-like system.


REQUIRES
--------
  perl5
  perl/Tk ver. >= 800.015


INSTALLATION
------------

Untar the distribution tarball using the following command:

	tar -xzf tkfs-0.2.tgz 

A distribution directory named tkfs-0.2 will be created.

In this directory you will find the following files and directories:

	README              (a readme file)
	INSTALL             (this file)
	tkfs                (a symlink to tkdisplaytree.pl)
	tkdisplaytree.pl    (the program itself)
	tkfslib/            (other files necessary for running tkfs)
	tkfsrc              (configuration file)


You may try to issue ./tkfs in this directory.


If you prefer having executable files in a different directory than
the libraries (tkfslib), you may follow the following instructions.

INSTALLING TO SEPARATE DIRECTORIES
----------------------------------

You may wish to move the whole tkfslib/ directory to a location of
your choice, move both tkfs and tkfsdisplaytree.pl files to some
directory in your PATH and make a copy of tkfsrc named .tkfsrc in your
home directory. To ensure that tkfs finds its lib-directory tkfslib
you may either set TKFSHOME environment variable to the location of
tkfslib or edit your .tkfsrc and add a line similar to the following:

LibDir  = "/my/favoured/location/for/tkfslib"


CUSTOMIZING Tkfs
----------------

Tkfs reads and uses a configuration file and macro-file (where user
may define his/her own macros (in Perl) and bind them easily to
keystrokes or menus). Tkfs searches for the configuration file in in
your home directory and also the directory from which it was
started. To customize tkfs, you may wish to make a copy of the
configuration file "tkfsrc" shipped with the distribution in your home
directory. This copy must be named ".tkfsrc" (note the dot at the
beginning). If you want Tkfs to read your own set of macro (instead
the default sample set "tkfslib/tkfs.mac"), you should point to it by
the option "macroFile" in your ".tkfsrc" like this:

macroFile = "/my/favoured/macro.set"
