Basic HOW-TO for TrEd maintanance.

* How do I fix a bug in the documentation

The source of TrEd documentation (the manual) is in
tred/documentation/manual/tred.xml.

The source for TrEd's WEB page is tred/documentation/index.html

The result of a change can be tested by compiling the documentation in
the working copy by calling:

	cd tred
	devel/make_manual
	firefox documentation/index.html # e.g.

Don't forget to commit the changes and create a new release.

* How do I create a new extension for TrEd

See TrEd's manual and use other extensions available in extensions/ as
an example. Extensions like conll2009 or hydt are quite good templates.

* Where do I put my new TrEd extensions essential to TrEd

Assume your new extension is named YOUR_EXTENSION. The easiest way is
to use TrEd's SVN to store the extension. In that case, just:

	cd extensions/
	cp -R PATH_TO_YOUR_WORK_DIR/YOUR_EXTENSION .
	svn add YOUR_EXTENSION
	svn commit -m 'Added new extension YOUR_EXTENSION'

Then you can release the extension (see below how).

If you wan't to keep the extension in a different SVN, you can still
add it to the TrEd's tree as an SVN external:

	cd extensions/
	svn propedit svn:externals
	# in the editor, add
	YOUR_EXTENSION https://svn.ms.mff.cuni.cz/svn/YOUR_PROJECT/PATH_TO/YOUR_EXTENSION
	# save file and close the editor
	svn commit -m 'added YOUR_EXTENSION external' .
	svn up

Now, each time the extensions/ directory is SVN-updated, the
up-to-date version of your extension is fetched from your SVN.

If you can't do even that, you are on your own. Either setup a
repository and ask your users to add it in TrEd's Extension Manager
(see TrEd User's Manual for details) or pack and install the extension
to the default repository by hand:


	TRED_DEVEL_DIR=/net/work/projects/tred
	REPO_SOURCE=/home/pajas/WWW/tred/extensions
	cd PATH_TO_YOUR_WORK_DIR/
	ls YOUR_EXTENSION # you must be on the same level

	$TRED_DEVEL_DIR/tred/devel/pack_extension.sh YOUR_EXTENSION $REPO_SOURCE

	$EDITOR $REPO_SOURCE/packages.lst
	# add YOUR_EXTENSION on a separate line (if not present)
	# save and exit

	cd $TRED_DEVEL_DIR
	make sync-www

* Where do I put my new TrEd extension not essential to TrEd

Put it anywhere you like, but when releasing it, use
extensions/release_extension with remote set to
ufal.mff.cuni.cz:/usr/share/drupal7/legacy/tred/extensions/external/.

* How do I manage extension versioned on git?

Create empty extension directory in the extensions/ and then use extensions/.make.d/pmltq
as an template for git syncing script

* How do I release a new version of an extension

If your extension is in the extensions/ dir, run:
	cd extensions
	./make <extension_name>
	cd ..
	make sync-www

Otherwise see above.

* How do I release TrEd

The easiest way to release TrEd is to connect to TrEd-testbed-master virtual
machine, which is running in VirtualBox on virtualbox.ufal.hide.ms.mff.cuni.cz.
User tred has a checkout of the SVN with all necessary tools and Perl modules
installed. So you can just go to the ~/tred_svn/, udate the svn (by 'svn up')
and execute 'make release test publish'. The final 'publish' target will ask you
for a login and password to ufal.mff.cuni.cz. The account must have proper
access rights to TrEd web page storage.

For more details about releasing TrEd please see README file.

* How do I add a new dependency

Each package not available by minimal supported Perl distribution
(5.8.x) must be included in the installation packages:

For UNIX:
	- list the dependency in tred/devel/unix_install/install.cfg
	- if not available on CPAN, add hook to fetch the distribution
          package
	- commit the changes to SVN
	- run make update-unix-dep-packages
	- run make test-dep-packages

For Windows:
	- list the dependency in tred/devel/winsetup/packages_list_58
          (if needed for Perl 5.8) and
	  tred/devel/winsetup/packages_list_510 (if needed for Perl
          5.10)
	- use e.g. http://kobesearch.cpan.org/ (or Google) to find a
          repository where PPD packages for Active Perl 5.8 and 5.10
	  are available for the newly added module
	- commit the changes to SVN
	- make sure the repository is listed in
		get_packages_tred_58.sh
	  and
		get_packages_tred_510.sh
	- run:
		make update-win32-dep-packages

And eventually release TrEd.

* How do I add a new command to the main menu of TrEd

You have implemented a new main-application feature of TrEd (not just
an extension) and you want to add it to the menu.

For example, suppose you want to add an entry named 'Preview in 3D'
into the 'View' menu. The function will be implemented as a function
named 'preview3D' in the main package of TrEd which takes the TrEd's
frame-group variable '$grp' variable as its only argument. Do the
following:

- edit the file: ./tredlib/TrEd/Menu/menubar.inc

- find an entry corresponding to the menu or sub-menu where you want to
add your entry (MENUBAR:VIEW in our example)

- add a symbolic hierarchical ID of your entry (of your choice
provided it is unique) to the the corresponding list of subentries:

	  'MENUBAR:VIEW' => [
	      'Cascade',
	      'View',
	      {
		'-underline' => 0
	       },
	      [
		'MENUBAR:VIEW:LIST_OF_SENTENCES',
		'SEPARATOR',
		...
		...
		'MENUBAR:VIEW:PREVIEW_IN_3D', # <-- your newly added entry
	      ]
	  ],

- add a top-level entry to the main HASH using the ID as key
  describing the menu entry:

	  'MENUBAR:VIEW:PREVIEW_IN_3D' => [
	      'Button',
	      'Preview in 3D',
	      {
		'-command' => [\&preview3D,$grp],
		'-underline' => 11, # underline 3 as a keyboard shortcut
	       },
	      undef
	     ],

Then, document the new entry the TrEd's User Manual
(documentation/manual/tred.xml).

* How do I add a new configuration option to TrEd

For historical reasons, TrEd stores most of its configuration options
in variables of the package $TrEd::Config which are (for even more
historical reasons) all exported to the package 'main'. (I know!)

To declare a new configuration option, add a variable to @EXPORT
(check for name collisions in 'tred' first!)

Then add a line like

   $yourNewOptionVariable=val_or_def($confs,"youroption",'DEFAULT VALUE');

where $yourNewOptionVariable is the variable you added,
'youroption' is the name of the new option (all lowercase here!,
user's may use e.g. YourOption in their ~/.tredrc) and 'DEFAULT VALUE'
is the default value.

You may also add a commented-out example of usage and some short
description to tredlib/tredrc.

Please don't forget to document the option in the TrEd's User Manual
(documentation/manual/tred.xml)!

* How do I add a new command-line option to TrEd

First, consider adding just a configuration option (those can be set
from the command-line using the -O option=value syntax).

Then, make sure neither the long nor the short name is not used for
something else in btred or ntred. If yes (and especially if either way
one of the options could somehow make sense for the other tool),
consider a different name. Note that you don't have to provide a short
name for options less likely to be used.

Declare a global variable for the option in the 'use vars
section'. If the command-line option corresponds to a configuration
option, use this global variable only as a temporary holder of the
value and set the corresponding configuration variable according to
the command-line option value in sub ApplyGlobalConfig { ... }.

Don't forget to update the POD in 'tred' (and 'btred', 'ntred',
wherever you added the option) and also TrEd's User Manual
(documentation/manual/tred.xml)!

* What are the $grp and $win variables used inside 'tred'

* Where is the function XY called from 'tred' implemented?
