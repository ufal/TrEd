This directory contains TrEd installation for Windows.

Installing TrEd on Windows is simple:

Start "setup.exe" from this directory and follow the instructions.

The installer first checks that a suitable version of ActivePerl is
present. If not, it will offer you the possibility to download and
install it for you. At this point you can also download and install it
yourself, by visiting

http://www.activestate.com/Products/Download/Download.plex?id=ActivePerl

Using the MSI installer is recommended.

When ActivePerl is installed, the setup wizard will install all
required Perl modules from PPM packages and then copy TrEd to a
location you have selected.
