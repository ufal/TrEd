;; The following file should contain pfa poscript

;; Tkfs cannot use its metrics to draw the tree, so
;; it should be the same as for display font or as similar as possible
;; For example, you may use postsript font for display too, which however
;; leads in low speed performance (reendering is slow)
;; You may also use a bitmap form of the postscript font for display
;; (if you have it). Also some pairs of fonts like Arial/Helvetica have
;; so similar metrices that they can be used together.
;; The following is also default:
