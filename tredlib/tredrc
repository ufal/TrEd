;; Font may be given in two ways: on X11 (Unix) platforms you may
;; give a (possibly incomplete) X11 font-spec, i.e.: 
;;
;;  Font = -*-helvetica-medium-r-normal--12-*-*-*-*-*-iso8859-2
;;
;; The the font spec must in this case start with a dash `-'.
;;
;; You may also specify font attributes in the following way (works on
;; all platforms, but has limitations):
;; 
;;	"<attribut>:<value>,..."
;;
;; attributes may be these: family, size, weight, slant, underline, overstrike
;; size is given in points (! not pixels !)
;; values for weight: normal, bold
;; values for slant: roman, italics
;; values for underline and overstrake: 0,1
;;
;; Example:
;; 	Font = "family:Arial,size:10,weight:bold"

;; The following file should contain pfa poscript

;; leads in low speed performance (reendering is slow)
;; You may also use a bitmap form of the postscript font for display
;; (if you have it). Also some pairs of fonts like Arial/Helvetica have
