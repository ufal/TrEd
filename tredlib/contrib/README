This directory contains various contributed macro packages for TrEd.

Each package should be placed in a separate directory. Cross-package
dependencies are allowed.

This directory should contain only one macro file "contrib.mac".

By default it includes all "contrib.mac" files of all packages in this
directory. It may also define an open_file_hook for TrEd allowing for
selection of the best probable context for every opened file.
