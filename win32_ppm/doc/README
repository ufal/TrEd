How to install PPM packages manually:
-------------------------------------

On command prompt type:

ppm

The ppm command is part of the ActiveState Perl instalation and can be
found (as ppm.bat) in the same directory as perl.exe (usually
c:\perl\bin\ppm.bat). If the command shell complains about unknown
command, you may need to fully qualify the path to ppm.bat.

On the PPM prompt (ppm>):


1) create a repository from your current directory

ppm> rep add localdir .
Repositories:
[1] ActiveState Package Repository
[2] ActiveState PPM2 Repository
[3] localdir

2) make localdir the only active repository, like

ppm> rep off Pa
Repositories:
[1] ActiveState PPM2 Repository
[2] localdir
[ ] ActiveState Package Repository
ppm> rep off PP
Repositories:
[1] localdir
[ ] ActiveState Package Repository
[ ] ActiveState PPM2 Repository

3) install all non-installed packages from localdir 

ppm> search *
