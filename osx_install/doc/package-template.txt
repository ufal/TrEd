Release Template Preparation Details
====================================
This document describes the details of the release package and gives guidelines
how to prepare the release template disk image.

1) Creating The Image
  The most convenient way to create the dmg image is to use Disk Utility. The
  disk MUST be read/write, without encryption, and with single partition formated
  to Mac OS Journaled filesystem. Recommended size is 200 MB at least. The label
  of the disk should be set appropriately (e.g., "Tred Install"). When the image
  is created, mount it (It will mount to /Volumes/<disk-name>). You can mount it
  from the Disk Utility or by
  
  $> hdiutil attach <path-to-dmg-image>


2) Bundled Application
  The application bundle is saved in the TrEd.app folder in the dmg image. The
  bundle is already prepared in the ./template subdirectory. Of course, the .svn
  dirs must be removed after the template is copied from the SVN repository.
  Do not remove or modify any files, unless you are familiar with Mac OS X
  application bundles.
  
  The Application was created by Platypus (http://sveinbjorn.org/platypus/)
  script wrapper. It was configured to execute trivial bash script
  (in Resources/script), which redirects TrEd stdout and stderr to log file
  in ~/tred.d and executes start_tred script. The platypus was provided with
  basic application info, application icon, and set not to display output. 


3) Symlink to /Applications
  Create a symlink to /Applications folder in the root of the dmg image. Run
  $> ln -s /Applications ./Applications
  from the mounted image root. 


4) Background Image
  Copy ./template/.background folder to the image. Again, do not forget to
  skip or remove the .svn dir.

4) Design
  Open the image root. You should see standard folder with two items (TrEd
  application and Applications symlink). Note that you should not see the
  .background dir since it is starting with dot, thus it is hidden.
  Right click to the folder (not on the icons) and select "Show View Options".
  Now you can configure the background, icon size, and the font size. Place
  icons on proper places relative to the background.
  
  Hint: Use Cmd-Shift-G and type path to the .background dir to open it and
  get to the background image. 


5) Finalization, Image Compression
  Close the root folder, detach the image.

  $> hdiutil detach /dev/disk<number-of-the-disk>
  
  The /dev/disk path is shown when the image is being attached. If you wish to
  compress the image, use:
  
  $> hdiutil convert <dmg-image> -format UDZO -o <output-image> -ov
  - to compress read/write image into small read-only image (-ov means overwrite
    existing files)

  $> hdiutil convert <dmg-image> -format UDRW -o <output-image> -ov
  - to unpack small read-only image into read/write image

  Please note that the make-release.sh script requires read-write
  (non-compressed) image.
