How to Release a TrEd Application Bundle for Mac OS X
=====================================================

Prerequisites, Restrictions
----------------------------
- This process has been tested on OS X Lion. It SHOULD work on newer OS X
  versions, but it was not tested.
- The install_tred.bash script must work on the host Mac, since it is used for
  creating the bundle. Therefore Xcode tools (especially make and gcc) are
  required on the host.
- UFAL Developer ID certificate must be installed in the keychain of the machine
  which builds the TrEd application bundle. The SHA1 fingerprint (which is used
  to identify the certificate) must be correctly set in the 'scripts/.config'
  (variable SIGN_CERT_SHA1).
  Please note that the private key of the certificate must be set so that all
  applications have access to it (Keychain -> right click on the private key
  -> Get Info -> Access Control Tab -> "Allow all applications to access ...") 


Step-by-step guide
------------------
This is quick step-by-step guide that should suffice if you need quickly create
the release.
1) Create a release template in a virtual disk image and save it as
  release-template.dmg into ./scripts subdirectory. You can either do this
  manually (follow package-template.txt documentation) or you can used pre-built
  binary file packed in ./bin directory (see ./bin/readme).
2) Copy or move your release-template.dmg into ./scripts. If you choose another
  location, fix paths in configuration (see step 3). 
3) Check ./scripts/.config file whether all paths and URLs are correct.
4) Make sure all virtual disks are not mounted.
5) Make sure the TrEd version you wish to bundle is pre-released at tred/testbed
  web (the script will download tred_install.bash script from there).
6) Execute the make-release.sh script. More detailed description of its
  internals is in the following section. The script should create tred.dmg file
  in ./scripts dir (if default configuration is used).
7) Use upload.sh to upload the tred.dmg to the testbed. Or you can copy it
  elsewhere (e.g., by scp).


How the releasing process works
-------------------------------
The process itself is quite simple. The idea is to create dmg disk image that
contains complete TrEd application in one folder, symlink to /Applications
folder, specific background, and config file for disk image root folder. When
the disk image is opened, its root folder is shown in OS X file browser. The
config file ensures, that our image (with arrow and explanations) is used as
background and both icons (TrEd, Application symlink) are at proper places, so
the user just drags the TrEd icon over the Application folder and drops it.

The TrEd application bundle (TrEd.app folder) has standard structure as every
application. In the Contents dir are OS X configuration file which tell the
system that this folder is an application folder and how to execute the
application. MacOS folder contains the main executable script start-tred.sh and
tred subfolder where the tred itself is installed. The Resources folder contains
the application icon.

Everything except the TrEd itself (i.e., the TrEd.app/Contents/MacOS/tred
subfolder) is prepared in the release template. The make-release.sh script
takes the template adds tred into it and converts the dmg into compressed,
read-only version of DMG image.

The script performs these steps:
1) Mount release-template image.
2) Clear files and directories that may linger from previous builds and TrEd
  application (if installed).
3) Download install_tred.bash from testbed.
4) Copy application template (TrEd.app) from the template image to /Applications.
5) Install TrEd into /Applications/TrEd.app/Contents/MacOS/tred.
6) Copy /Applications/TrEd.app/Contents/MacOS/tred into the template image.
7) Unmount the image and create its compressed version (as a new file).

Note: the hdiutil command line tool is used to manipulate with DMG images.
