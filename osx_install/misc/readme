- mac-mini/build-tred-dmg.sh - A shell script for the host system on which the
  development VM is running (starts VM, executes the building process, and
  shuts down the VM again).
- virtualbox/build-tred-dmg.sh - A frontend script that just calls a script of
  the same name inside the Mac Mini. Therefore, user needs only to access the
  virtualbox server and not the Mac.
