The release-template-packed.dmg file represents DMG (OS X disk image) file with
prepared template for the release DMG. The only thing missing in the template
is the TrEd itself. It can be added by make-release.sh script.

Quick-start:
- Run unpack.sh which unpacks the packed template into release-template.dmg
- Copy/move release-template.dmg to ../scripts
- Now you can start releasing the TrEd (run ../scripts/make-release.sh)
