* TrEd [9/24]

 - [ ] display current filelist (or a tree of file-lists) and a
       filesystem-browser in the side-bar
 - [X] allow the stylesheet to define raise-order of canvas items
       rootstyle:#{stackOrder:line,point,...}
 - [X] allow the nodes to take dimensions of the textbox
       #{Node-surroundtext:1}
 - [X] allow empty text labels to be skipped on each node
       #{NodeLabel-skipempty:1}, #{EdgeLabel-skipempty:1}
 - [X] allow positioning of the tree levels based on actual text
       heights (with possibly skipped labels)
 - [X] create dimensions and position of the textbox according to
       non-empty labels
 - [ ] value-line: support for displaying preceding and following
       context (differentiated e.g. by font size or colour)
 - [X] allow additional textlabels, positioned using #{-coords:...} and
       anchoring (float:)
 - [ ] undo for tree-related Node-menu items 
 - [ ] document various side-effects (setting $this/$root in GotoFile,
       ...)
 - [ ] fix: undo/redo on add/delete node (e.g. in PML_T) breaks
       id-hashes
 - [ ] make lower-level operations id-hash aware
 - [ ] add an option to TrEd to remember the last context and
       stylesheet used for a postponed file and restore them on resume
 - [X] in TrEd: keep this file (i.e. do not close this particular file
       automatically when opening another)
 - [X] after Save File As it does not appear in the recent files
       fixed: recent-files are updated on every saveFile and closeFile
 - [ ] make use of Tk::QueryDialog
 - [ ] a dynamic keyboard/menu bind-adopter
 - [ ] add macro: ChangeFilename() (take its guts from saveFileAs).
 - [ ] allow patterns use something like ${@V} to get direct access to
       the value attribute, ${@N} for the numbering attribute, etc.
 - [ ] make ${@O} (or similar) in patterns return the actual index of
       the node in left-to-right order of \@nodes returned by the
       hook; ${@L} could be the node-level, ${@X} and ${@Y} for its
       coordinates, etc.
 - [ ] on-line help for default bindigs with HTML output
 - [ ] add a register_context_guesser macro
 - [X] fix <Escape> binding: error is spit if Escape is first used to
       close the stylesheet-editor and then a node-attribute editor.
       Fixed this and possible similar errors by avoiding bind('all',...).
 - [ ] document #{Node-surroundtext:1}, #{NodeLabel-skipempty:1},
       #{EdgeLabel-skipempty:1}, float:..., node:#{-option:value}

* NTrEd [0/1]

  - [ ] SSH tunneling in NTrEd


* TreeView

  - an idea:

    introduce stylesheet labels:
    
    tree-order: (aka ord/dord)
    line-order: (aka sentord)

    This 1) eliminates the need to have these in dedicated attributes,
    2) allows for better coustomization.

* PMLSchema

  - [ ] document PMLSchema's for_each_decl
  - [ ] setters in PMLSchema objects
