- display current filelist (or a tree of file-lists) in the side-bar
- SSH tunneling in NTrEd
- allow the stylesheet to define raise-order of canvas items
- allow the nodes to take dimensions of the textbox
- allow empty text labels to be skipped on each node
- allow positioning of the tree levels based on actual text heights (with possibly skipped labels)
- create dimensions and position of the textbox according to non-empty labels
- value-line: support for displaying preceding and following context (differentiated e.g. by font)

- undo for tree-related Node-menu items 

- make use of Tk::QueryDialog

- a dynamic keyboard/menu bind-adopter

- add macro: ChangeFilename() (take its guts from saveFileAs).

- allow patterns use something like ${@V} to get direct access to the
  value attribute, ${@N} for the numbering attribute, etc.

Make an on-line help for:
  - default bindigs

- add a register_context_guesser function

TreeView:
---------
introduce stylesheet labels:

tree-order: (aka ord/dord)
line-order: (aka sentord)

This 1) eliminates the need to have these in dedicated attributes,
2) allows for better coustomization.

PMLSchema
---------
- document PMLSchema's for_each_decl
- setters in PMLSchema objects
