- undo for tree-related Node-menu items 

- add a command-line flag to turn off backup file creation
  (non-trivial: backups are used for recovery from I/O errors; should we just unlink the backup aftre a successfull write?)

- make use of Tk::QueryDialog

- a dynamic keyboard/menu binder 

- add macro: ChangeFilename() (take its guts from saveFileAs).

- allow patterns use something like ${@V} to get direct access to the
  value attribute, ${@N} for the numbering attribute, etc.

Make an on-line help for:
  - default bindigs
  - stylesheet patterns

- add a register_context_guesser function

TreeView:
---------
introduce stylesheet labels:

tree-order: (aka ord/dord)
line-order: (aka sentord)

This 1) eliminates the need to have these in dedicated attributes,
2) allows for better coustomization.

PMLSchema
---------

- document PMLSchema's for_each_decl

- setters in PMLSchema objects
