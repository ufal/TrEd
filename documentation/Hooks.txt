User definable hooks in TrEd
============================

Before and sometimes after some action is performed, TrEd tries to
call a user defined hook function. These function may be used to alter
TeEd's default behaviour or even to prevent the execution of the
planned action. If the later is the case, the hook function must
return a scalar value of "stop". Here is the list of defined hook
functions with a description of the parameters passed to them by TrEd.


hook	       parameters	       stop   description
----------------------------------------------------------------------

start_hook	none			yes	executed before the
						MainLoop is entered

exit_hook	none			no	executed when
						top-level window is
						destroyed, before
						askSaveFile is executed
do_edit_attrs_hook

enable_attr_hook                                

edit_attr_hook	attr,type		yes	executed before
						attribute "attr" is edited by
						user in a GUI. Type "type"
						may be one of "ambiguous","normal"





NOTE:
Unlike other macros, hooks are expected not to modify the file. If the
file is modified, the hook-function should set the $FileNotSaved
variable to 1. Also no getNodes or setCurrent or redraw_tree or
centerTo is performed when a hook is called!
