    <a name="intro"></a><h2>Introduction</h2> 
    <p>TrEd is a graphical editor and viewer of tree structures (look at a screenshot
    <a href="pics/tred1.png">here</a>). It works with
      files in so called <a
    href="../../../../Corpora/PDT_1.0/Doc/fs.html">FS-format</a> developed by
      M. Kren (the same file format is used also in editor 
      <a href="../Graph/index.html">Graph</a>) and used for syntactical and
      tectogrammatical trees in The Prague Dependency Treebank.  Since
      Fs-format is a bit more general, TrEd may also find some
      other applications.
    </p>
    <p>TrEd may be extended by <b>user-defined macros</b> written in Perl with
      many pre-defined functions for handling Fs-trees. Macros may be assigned
      keyboard shortcuts or may be inserted to user-defined menu.
    </p>
    <p>There is also an non-graphical (off-line) variant of TrEd called
      btred - "Batch-mode Tree Editor" - which allows user to run macros on
      trees without having to enter the graphical interface.
    </p>
    <p>
      TrEd runs on the following platforms (see <a href="#chap1">installation
      instructions</a> for details):
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Windows 95/98/ME or Windows NT/2000 (TM)</li>
      <li>Linux (with <tt>libc.6</tt>)</li>
      <li>UNIX, Solaris (TM) and other UNIX-based systems</li>
    </ul>

    <a name="chap1"></a><h2>Installation and start up instructions</h2>

    <p>
      On all supported platforms TrEd requires Perl to be installed and
      Tk toolkit (a library of GUI functions). Installation of these
      tools is different on all supported platforms. Installation of
      TrEd itself is platform-independent.
    </p>
    <p>
      To install Perl/Tk on your system follow instructions for your
      platform below:
    </p>

    <h3>Windows</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
	Start with installing Perl support to Windows from
	<a href="http://www.activestate.com">ActiveState</a>. 
	This is done by running the installation program
	<a href="..\PerlTk\APi522e.exe"><tt>APi522e.exe</tt></a> from the
	<tt>Tools\Tree_Editors\Tred\PerlTk</tt> 
	directory on this CD. Follow the instructions
	of the installation program. (When the installation is done, you may
	need to restart Windows, so that all the changes take
	effect.)
      </li>
      <li>
	In this step you add Tk toolkit to Perl.
	If you have on-line connection to the Internet you may
	install the latest Tk toolkit from ActiveState's site
	in the following steps:
	<ol>
	  <li>Open a command prompt (MS-DOS prompt in Windows
	  9x/ME)</li> 
	  <li>Type <tt>ppm</tt> (press <b>Enter</b>)</li>
	  <li>Type <tt>install Tk</tt> (press <b>Enter</b>)</li>
	  <li>When the installation of Tk toolkit is finished, type
	    <tt>exit</tt> (press <b>Enter</b>)</li>
	  <li>Close the command prompt</li>
	</ol>
	If you do <b>not</b> have on-line connection to the Internet,
	follow these steps:
	<ol>
	  <li>Open a command prompt (MS-DOS prompt in Windows&nbsp;9x/ME)</li> 
	  <li>Change directory to <tt>Tools\Tree_Editors\Tred\PerlTk</tt> on
	    the CD, i.e. if your CD-ROM drive is <tt>D:</tt>, type
	    <blockquote><tt>cd D:\Tools\Tree_Editors\Tred\PerlTk</tt></blockquote>
	    Under Windows&nbsp;9x you may rather need to use command	    
	    <blockquote><tt>cd D:\Tools\Tree_~1\Tred\PerlTk</tt></blockquote>
	  </li>
	  <li>Type <tt>ppm install Tk.ppd</tt> (press <b>Enter</b>)</li>
	  <li>Close the command prompt when the installation of Tk
	    toolkit is finished.</li>
	</ol>
      </li>
      <li>
	In this step you install TrEd itself. It is done by copying
	the whole <tt>Tred</tt> folder from the CD
	(<tt>Tools\Tree_Editors\Tred\Tred</tt>) somewhere on your
	hard-disk, i.e. to folder <tt>C:\Program Files</tt>.
	To run TrEd double-click the <tt>tred.pl</tt> icon in the
	<tt>Tred</tt> folder on your hard-disk. (You may also want to
	create a short-cut on your desktop).
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Linux</h3> 
    <p>
      This instructions apply only to RedHat Linux or derived
      distributions. If you use other distribution, follow the general
      UNIX instructions below.
    </p>
    <p>
      RedHat Linux contains Perl in
      default installation, so we may expect that you have
      already Perl installed. You only have to install PerlTk
      toolkit and TrEd:      
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
	To install PerlTk, as a <tt>root</tt> issue the following
	command from the <tt>Tools/Tree_Editors/Tred/PerlTk</tt>
	directory on the CD:
	<blockquote><tt>root# <b>rpm -i perl-Tk-800.018-1.i386.rpm</b></tt></blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>
	<p>
	  To install TrEd,
	  the whole <tt>Tred</tt> folder from the CD
	  (<tt>Tools/Tree_Editors/Tred/Tred</tt>) somewhere on your
	  hard-disk, i.e. to your home directory or <tt>/opt</tt>
	  directory. 
	</p>
	<p>
	  <small>
	    You may also wish to install the <tt>tred</tt>
	    executable to some directory on your <tt>PATH</tt>. In that
	    case you only have to provide a way for Tred to find its
	    library files. It can be done either by setting the
	    <tt>TREDHOME</tt> variable to point to the location where
	    you have made a copy of the <tt>Tred/Tredlib</tt> directory, or
	    by copying the <tt>tred</tt> executable and the
	    <tt>Tredlib</tt> directory into the directories
	    <tt>bin</tt> and <tt>lib</tt> respectively, on the same
	    level of directory structure.
	  </small>
	</p>
	<p>
	  The same that holds for the <tt>tred</tt> executable should
	  be used for the <tt>btred</tt> executable as well.
	</p>
      </li>
      <li>
	TrEd is ran by executing the <tt>tred</tt> executable. (See
	details on command-line arguments below.)
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>UNIX based systems</h3>
    <p>
      Almost every UNIX/Linux system contains Perl in default
      installation, so we may expect that you have already Perl
      installed on your box and you only need to install PerlTk
      toolkit and TrEd:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
	To install PerlTk toolkit, 
	un-tar the
	<a href="../Tk800.022.tar.gz"><tt>Tk800.022.tar.gz</tt></a> archive
	to some temporary directory, e.g. with the following command:
	<blockquote><tt>bash$ <b>gunzip&nbsp;-c Tk800.022.tar.gz | tar&nbsp;-x</b></tt></blockquote>
	and issue the following commands (see file <tt>INSTALL</tt> in
	the <tt>Tk800.022</tt> directory for details):
	<blockquote>
	  <tt>bash$ <b>cd Tk800.022</b><br>
	    bash$ <b>perl Makefile.PL</b><br>
	    bash$ <b>make</b><br>
	    bash$ <b>make test</b></tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(this is
	  only to test the compilation, you may skip it)<br>
	  <tt>bash$ <b>su</b></tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(make yourself
	    root)<br>
	  <tt>root# <b>make install</b></tt>
	</blockquote>	
      </li>
      <li>
	<p>
	  Installation of TrEd on a UNIX box is same as on Linux.
	  To install TrEd,
	  the whole <tt>Tred</tt> folder from the CD
	  (<tt>Tools/Tree_Editors/Tred/Tred</tt>) somewhere on your
	  hard-disk, i.e. to your home directory or <tt>/opt</tt>
	  directory. 
	</p>
	<p>
	  <small>
	    You may also wish to install the <tt>tred</tt>
	    executable to some directory on your <tt>PATH</tt>. In that
	    case you only have to provide a way for Tred to find its
	    library files. It can be done either by setting the
	    <tt>TREDHOME</tt> variable to point to the location where
	    you have made a copy of the <tt>Tred/Tredlib</tt> directory, or
	    by copying the <tt>tred</tt> executable and the
	    <tt>Tredlib</tt> directory into the directories
	    <tt>bin</tt> and <tt>lib</tt> respectively, on the same
	    level of directory structure.
	  </small>
	</p>
	<p>
	  The same that holds for the <tt>tred</tt> executable should
	  be used for the <tt>btred</tt> executable as well.
	</p>
      </li>
      <li>
	TrEd is ran by executing the <tt>tred</tt> executable or
	typing <tt>perl <i>tred</i></tt> (in the later case full-path to
	<tt><i>tred</i></tt> should be specified). See
	details on command-line arguments below.<br>
	<small>If executing of the <tt>tred</tt> executable fails,
	  change the first (<tt>#!/usr/bin/perl</tt>) line to point to
	your Perl executable. If you find Tred
	halting immediately, complaining about <tt>Tk.pm</tt> module,
	check PerlTk installation path. You may need to
	setup <tt>PERLLIB</tt> variable to point to the
	<tt>site_perl</tt> directory on your system to which the
	<tt>Tk.pm</tt> module was installed.</small>
      </li>

    <a name="chap2"></a><h2>Menu commands</h2>
    
    <p>
      The following paragraphs describe menu commands. Each submenu in
      TrEd has as its first item a tear-off line
      (<tt>-&nbsp;-&nbsp;-&nbsp;-&nbsp;-</tt>)
      which can be used to tear the menu off and place it 
      as a separate window beside the TrEd's main window.
    </p>    
    <a name="file"></a>
    <h3><img src="pics/blue.gif"> File</h3>
    <b>Open ...</b><br>
    <p>Opens an existing file that the user
      chooses in the <b>Open</b> dialog box. The file may be either
      in the
      <a href="../../../../Corpora/PDT_1.0/Doc/fs.html">FS-format</a>
      (usually a file with a <tt>.fs</tt> extension)
      or a file in the
      <a href="../../../../Corpora/PDT_1.0/Doc/csts.dtd">CSTS</a> SGML
      format. In the later case a conversion filter from CSTS to FS
      format (e.g.
      <a href="../../../../Utilities/cstsfs/index.html"><tt>2804</tt></a>)
      must be properly installed on your system and TrEd's
      configuration option <tt>CstsToFs</tt> set to point to it (see
      section on <a href="#configuration">configuration</a> bellow).
      Hence current version of TrEd allowes saving a file only in
      FS-format, the <tt>.fs</tt> extension is appended to names
      of all files converted from CSTS format.
    </p>
    <p>
      TrEd expects files in the ISO-8859-2 (ISO Latin 2) encoding
      (which  by TrEd is transparently translated to
      and fro to codepage 1250 on Microsoft Windows Systems).
    </p>
    <b>Save</b><br>
    <p>
      Saves the active file to the disk. A backup file is created by
      appending a tilde `~' to the filename (which is a UNIX convention
      for naming backups).
    </p>
    <b>Save As ...</b><br>
    <p>
      Prompts user for a new name of the file using a standard file
      dialog and then performs the <b>Save</b> command.
    </p>
    <b>Previous File</b><br>
    <p>
      Closes the active file (asking user to
      save it if modified) and opens the previous file given to TrEd
      as an argumet on the command-line (see section on starting TrEd
      from command-line <a href="#commandline">below</a>).
    </p>
    <b>Next File</b><br>
    <p>
      Closes the active file (asking user to
      save it if modified) and opens the next file given to TrEd
      as an argumet on the command-line (see section on starting TrEd
      from command-line <a href="#commandline">below</a>).
    </p>
    <b>Print ...</b><br>
    <p>
      Opens a Print Dialog. TrEd can only print to PostScript or
      Encapsulated PostScript which works fine on Unix/Linux systems
      (using standard <tt>lpr</tt> command). On a Windows System user
      may choose printing to file and then use a PostScript
      interpreter (e.g. <a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/">GhostView</a>) 
      to print the file. EPS files may be used for preparation of
      other printed materials i.e. PDF of LaTeX documents.
    </p>
    <small></small>
    <ul>
      <li>
	In the <b>Print</b> dialog you can specify a printing command to
	be used or (if Print to file is checked) a filename of the
	destination file.</li>
      <li>
	If <b>Create EPS</b> is checked, Encapsulated
	Postcript is created with the tightiest possible bounding box.
      </li>
      <li>When printing, TrEd always uses a PostSript (Type1) font from a
	file given by the <tt>PsFontFile</tt>
	<a href="#configuration">configuration</a> option.  I
	TrEd cannot, however, calculate the proper dimensions and kerning of
	the tree from the font file, so it expects the font to have the
	same or very similar metrics as the current font used on
	display. If it is not the case, you may specify another display
	font TrEd should get the metrics from, by setting the <tt>PsFontName</tt>
	option. The <b>Use Type1 Postsrcipt Font</b> button in the
      <b>Print</b> dialog must be checked to use this feature.
      </li>
      <li>
	By checking the <b>Use colors</b> button you force TrEd to use
	the colours used on display also for printing (except for
	background which is always white on the printer). If this button
	is not checked, black and white printing is used.
      </li>
      <li>
	It is possible to print more than one tree within one command. 
	This is realized by entering a list of numbers or ranges of
	numbers, that correspond to the desired trees or
	tree-ranges in the active file, to the 
	<b>Page range</b> field. First tree in the file has
	number 1, second has number 2, etc. Ranges are pairs of numbers like `3-20'
	which covers all trees starting from the tree no. 3 to no. 20.
	If the first number in the range is omitted, 1 is assumed. If the second
	number in the range is ommited, the number of the last tree in
	the active file is assumed.
	Multiple ranges and tree-numbers are be separated by a comma.
	The order of the trees given in the list is preserved and also,
	one tree may be printed more than once.
	<blockquote>
	  <b>Example:</b><br>
	  To print trees from 1 to 5, then trees no. 7, 11, 12 and 5
	  again, use e.g. one of the following lists:<br>
	  <tt>1-5,7,11,12,5</tt><br>
	  <tt>1-5,7,11-12,5</tt><br>
	  <tt>-5,7,11-12,5</tt>
	</blockquote>
      </li>
    </ul></small>
    <b>Edit config ...</b><br>
    <p>
      Opens a small configuration file editor
      (see <a href="#configuration">here</a> the details about
      configuration options). To apply the new configuration, save
      the configuration file to disk and leave the editor press the <b>Save and Apply</b>
      button. To apply changes without saving them and leaving the
      editor, press <b>Apply</b>. The <b>Cancel</b> button closes the
      editor without making any changes to the present configuration.      
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>NOTE:</b>
      Some configuration options even if applyed take effect only
      after restarting TrEd.
    </p>
    <b>Reload config ...</b><br>
    <p>
      Use this command to reload the configuration file from disk and
      apply the new options. This command is useful if you have
      changed the configuration file in some other editor or in an
      another running instance of TrEd. As above, note, that some
      configuration changes still take effect only after restarting TrEd.
    </p>
    <b>Quit</b><br>
    <p>Exits the editor and in case that active file is modified and
    not yet saved, prompts user to save it.</p>

    <a name="view"></a>
    <h3><img src="pics/blue.gif">View</h3>
    <b>View->Previous Tree</b><br>
    <p>
      Display previous tree in the current file.
    </p>    
    <b>View->Next Tree</b><br>
    <p>
      Display next tree in the current file.
    </p>
    <b>Draw Boxes</b><br>
    <p>If this item is checked, square boxes are drawn under all nodes
    and their attributes.</p>
    <b>Show Hidden Nodes</b><br>
    <p>
      Toggle displaying the hidden subtrees of the tree.
      If this item is checked, nodes makred as hidden using a special
      attribute (see 
      <a href="../../../../Corpora/PDT_1.0/Doc/fs.html">FS-format description</a>
      for details) and all their subtrees are also displayed.
    </p>
    <b>Highlight Attributes</b>
    <p>
      Toggle highlighting certain attributes with user-defined
      colors. See section on <a href="#configuration">configuration</a> for details on
      customizing colors and <a
      href="../../../../Corpora/PDT_1.0/Doc/fs.html">FS-format
      description</a> to learn about how to specify which attributes
      are highlighted.
    </p>
    <b>Visible attributes</b>
    <p>
      Opens a list box in which the user can select the
      attributes that should be displayed. Click the attribute name to
      select/deselect it. 
    </p>


    <a name="node"></a>
    <h3><img src="pics/blue.gif">Node</h3>
    <b>New Node</b><br>
    <p>
      Creates a new node and connects it as a child of the
      active node. All the attribute values of this node are left
      empty.
    </p>
    <b>Remove Active Node</b><br>
    <p>
      Passes all the children of the active node to its parent and
      deletes the active node. Does nothing if the active node is
      the root of the tree.
    </p>
    <b>Insert New Tree</b><br>
    <p>
      Inserts new tree <i>before</i> the current tree. The new tree consists
      of one empty node (its root) only.      
    </p>
    <b>Insert New Tree After</b><br>
    <p>
      Inserts new tree <i>after</i> the current tree. The new tree consists
      of one empty node (its root) only.      
    </p>
    <b>Remove Whole Current Tree</b><br>
    <p>
      Removes the current tree from the file and displays the
      following tree (or the preceding tree, in case the current tree
      was the last one in the file).
    </p>    
    <b>Edit Attributes</b><br>
    <p>
      Displays the <b>Edit Node Attributes</b> 
      dialog box with the list of all attributes defined
      for the file and the values assigned to them in the active node.
      There are two types of attributes and therefore two ways to edit
      them:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
	In case of an attribute where <i>no</i> fixed set of possible
	values is given
	(see <a href="../../../../Corpora/PDT_1.0/Doc/fs.html">FS-format
	  description</a> for details about types of attributes)
	the values of the attributes are displayed in a editable
	line and user may change simply edit them. The usual
	keyboard-shortcuts for Cut (<tt>Ctrl+X</tt>), 
	Copy (<tt>Ctrl+C</tt>) and Paste (<tt>Ctrl+V</tt>)
	operations may be used during the editing of the values.
      </li>
      <li>
	In case of attribute where a fixed set of possible values
	<i>is</i> given, user cannot simply edit the value entry, but
	to change it he/she must press the button <tt>[...]</tt> on the
	right of the value entry.
	A dialog box displays where user may select one or more
	(depending on the status of the <b>multiple select</b>
	check-box) values for the given attribute within the list of
	values from the predefined set.      
      </li>
    </ol>
    <b>Find ...</b><br>
    <p>
      This command displays a dialog box in which user may specify a
      search criterion for a node search based on regular expressions
      to match the desired nodes values. There is an entry for each
      defined attribute in which user may enter a
      <a href="regexps.html">regular expression</a>. When user presses
      <b>Find</b>, TrEd searches for the first node in the current
      file all the attributes of which match the given regular
      expressions. (If no regular expression is given for an
      attribute, this attribute always matches).  If a matching node
      is found, this node is made active.
    </p>
    <b>Find Next ...</b>
    <p>
      Searches for the first node matching a criteron given in a
      previous use of the <b>Find ...</b> command.

    <p>
      This menu is devoted for user-defined commands. The new commands
      may be defined in the macro file. See sections on macros below
      for details. Here is a brief description of the few default
      macros defined by author of TrEd. On the right of all commands
      is a default keyboard shortcut which can be used to invoke the
      command. The shortcuts are also assigned to the command in the
      macro file. (There are no keyboards shotrcuts assigned to the
      standard menu commands. The aim of this is not to block any
      possible shortcuts form the user, so that as many of them as
      possible remain availeble and user may use them
      for his/her own commands; there is also a possibility to define
      bindings for many of the standard menu commands within the macro
      file.)
    </p>
    <b>Copy Values</b> (<tt>F5</tt>)<br>
    <p>
      Copies all values of the active node to an internal
      clipboard. These values may be pasted to any other node using
      the <b>Paste Values</b> command.
    </p>    
    <b>Cut Subtree</b> (<tt>Ctrl+Insert</tt>)<br>
    <p>      
      Cuts the whole subtree of the active node and stores it in an
      iternal clipboard. It may be then pasted as a subtree of any
      of the remaining nodes with the <b>Paste Subtree</b> command.
    </p>    
    <b>Delete Node</b> (<tt>F8</tt>)<br>
    <p>
      Deletes active node. The node must be a leaf and must not be the
      root of the tree, otherwise this
      command is ignored.
    </p>
    <b>Goto to first tree</b> (<tt>Shift+&lt;</tt>)<br>
    <p>
      Displays the first tree in the file.
    </p>
    <b>Goto to last tree</b>  (<tt>Shift+></tt>)<br>
    <p>
      Displays the last tree in the file.
    </p>
    <b>Go to...</b> (<tt>Alt+G</tt>)<br>
    <p>
      Promts user to enter an ordinal number of a tree and displays it.
    </p>
    <b>New Node (r-brother)</b> (<tt>F7</tt>)<br>
    <p>
      Creates new node as a right brother of the active node (does
      nothing if the active node is root).      
    </p>
    <b>New Node (son)</b> (<tt>Shift+F7</tt>)<br>
    <p>
      Creates new node as a son of the active node.
    </p>
    <b>Paste Subtree</b> (<tt>Shift+Insert</tt>)<br>
    <p>
      Pastes the tree saved in an internal clipboard during the last
      call of the <b>Cut Subtree</b> command as a subtree of the
      active node.      
    </p>
    <b>Paste Values</b> (<tt>F8</tt>)<br>
    <p>
      Assignes the active nodes attribute values stored in an internal
      clipboard during the last call of the <b>Copy Values</b> command.
    </p>
    <b>Perl-Search</b> (<tt>Alt+H</tt>)<br>
    <p>
      Allows user enter any Perl expression and evaluates it along
      a way around the tree structure as long as the expression holds
      (results in non-zero defined value) for some node. The node is
      then made active.
      User may use the <tt>$node</tt> variable to refer to the
      current node and  <tt>$root</tt> variable to refer to
      the root of the tree.
      If <tt>$n</tt> refers to some node, then <tt>$n->{attr}</tt>
      is value of <tt>attr</tt> attribute for the node <tt>$n</tt>.
      The governor of a node <tt>$n</tt> is refered to as
      to <tt>Parent($n)</tt>, nearest left brother of <tt>$n</tt>
      in the tree structure is <tt>LBrother($n)</tt>;
      the right brother of <tt>$n</tt> is <tt>RBrother($n)</tt>.
      The first son of <tt>$n</tt> is referred to as to
      <tt>FirstSon($n)</tt>. If no such node exists, all these functions
      return zero `0'.
      Moreover, all the nodes of the tree are
      elements of the <tt>@nodes</tt> array (list)
      with the same order as they are displayed on the screen
      from left to right.<br>
      <b>NOTE:</b> <tt>LBrother($n)</tt> and <tt>RBrother($n)</tt>
      are not necesserilly displayed on left of <tt>$n</tt>.

    <p>
      Searches for the next node for which the Perl-expression
      given during the last call of <b>Perl-Search</b> command
      results in non-zero defined value.
    </p>
    <b>Swap nodes (values only)</b> (<tt>Ctrl+PageUp</tt>)
    <p>
      Makes the active node exchange all attribute values with its

    <!-- -------------------------------------------------------- -->

    <a name="chap3"></a><h2>Viewing and editing the tree structure and attributes</h2>

    <p>
      TrEd can be controlled either by keyboard or mouse.
      There are several pre-defined keyboard hotkeys
      to move the active-node (cursor) along the tree, to
      cut or paste subtrees and nodes (i.e modify the structure)
      and to open the dialog where attributes for the active node can
      be edited. Trees can also be easily modified by clicking and
      drag-and-drop. Both of these approaches are described bellow:
    </p>
    
    <b>I. MOUSE CONTROL</b>
    <p></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Clicking left or right mouse button on a node activates it.</li>
      <li>Double clicking left mouse button on a node invokes
	<B>Node->Edit Attribues</B> command.</li>
      <li>Double clicking left mouse button on the text of 
	a node's attribute opens a prompt for editing the value of
	this attribute.
      </li>
      <li>
	Dragging active node with left mouse button moves that node with
	its subtree to the new location. If user releases the button near
	another node, the active node becomes son of that node.	
      </li>
      <li>
	Dragging active node with right mouse button has the same
	effect but if the tree is too large to fit the window, the
	window "scrolls forward" as user gets near its edges.
      </li>
      <li>
	Dragging mouse with the middle mouse button pressed has the
	same "scrolling effect" described above, but no node is moved.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <b>II. Toolbar buttons</b>
    <p>
      The following toolbar-buttons provide mouse-oriented shortcuts
      for standard menu-commands:
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="pics/fileopen.png">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>File->Open ...</b><br>
      <img src="pics/filefloppy.png">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>File->Save</b><br>
      <img src="pics/fileprint.png">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>File->Print ...</b><br>
      <img src="pics/find.png">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Node->Find ...</b><br>
      <img src="pics/findnext.png">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Node->Find Next</b><br>
      <img src="pics/start.png">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>File->Previous File</b><br>
      <img src="pics/finish.png">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>File->Next File</b><br>
      <img src="pics/left.png">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>View->Previous Tree</b><br>
      <img src="pics/right.png">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>View->Next Tree</b><br>
      <img src="pics/tick.png">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>View->Visible Attributes</b><br>
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <b>III. KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS</b>
    <p>Cursor keys may be used to activate another node in the
      structure. Use <tt>left</tt>/<tt>right</tt>
      to activate the nearest left/right brother-node of
      the active node and <tt>up</tt>/<tt>down</tt> to activate the active node's
      ancestor (parent)/its leftmost son.
    </p>    
    <p>
      <tt>Tab</tt> and <tt>Shift+Tab</tt> keys activate the
      next/previous node on the way along the tree structure.
    </p>
    <p>
      <tt>Enter</tt> runs the <b>Node->Edit Attributes</b> command.
    </p>
    <p>
      To edit the tree structure with keyboard only, use the shortcuts
      bound to the <a href="#usercommands">User-defined menu
      commands</a>. Most important of those are:
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt><tt>Ctrl+Insert</tt> (<b>Cut Subtree</b>)<br></dt>
      <dd>      
	Cuts the whole subtree of the active node and stores it in an
	iternal clipboard. It may be then pasted as a subtree of any
	of the remaining nodes with the <b>Paste Subtree</b>
	command.
      </dd>    
      <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
      <dt><tt>Shift+Insert</tt> (<b>Paste Subtree</b>)</dt>
      <dd>
	Pastes the tree saved in an internal clipboard during the last

    <a name="configuration"></a><h2>Configuring and customizing TrEd</h2>

    The configuration and customizing of TrEd is possible through the
    configuration file. When started TrEd tries to search for its
    configuration file on several places and uses the first
    configuraton file found:

    <ol>
      <li>
	First TrEd looks for a file given with a command-line parameter
	<tt>-c</tt> (see section on <a href="#commandline">Starting TrEd from
	command-line</a> for details).
      </li>
      <li>    
	If the <tt>HOME</tt> system variable is set (on UNIX/Linux this
	variable points to user's home directory) TrEd searches for
	<tt>.tredrc</tt> (mind the dot here) file in that directory. 	
      </li>
      <li>
	If the <tt>TREDHOME</tt> system variable is set TrEd searches for
	<tt>tredrc</tt> file in that directory. 	
      </li>
      <li>
	TrEd looks for a <tt>tredrc</tt> file in 
	the directory where the program file of TrEd itself is located.
      </li>
      <li>
	TrEd looks for a <tt>tredrc</tt> file in 
	directories <tt>../lib/tred</tt>, <tt>../lib/tredlib</tt>
	and <tt>./tredlib/tredrc</tt> respectively,	
	relatvely to the directory where the program file of TrEd
	itself is located.
      </li>
      <li>
	TrEd looks for a <tt>tredrc</tt> file in 
	the <tt>/usr/share/config/</tt> directory.
      </li>
    </ol>

    If none of these files is found, default values for configuration
    options are used.

    TrEd's configuration file is a plain text file with a very simple
    structure. It can be edited not only in any editor (like vi, Emacs
    or Notepad) and also directly from TrEd when the <b>File->Edit
    Config</b> menu command is issued. In both cases there is a way to
    update the options used by a running session of TrEd:
    
    <ul>
      <li>Use <b>File->Reload Config</b> menu command to make TrEd
	re-read the configuration file from disk.</li>
      <li>
	In the TrEd's internal configuration editor use the <b>Save
	and Apply</b> button to apply changes and save them or
	<b>Apply</b> button to apply changes withought saving them.
	The first command aslo quits the configuration editor.
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <b>NOTE:</b>
      Some configuration options even if applyed take effect only
      after restarting TrEd.
    </p>

    The format of the configuration file is of this simple form:
    <blockquote><tt>option_name = value</tt></blockquote>

    There may be any amount of white-space between the option name and
    value but they must be both on the same line. Any characters
    folowing a semi-colon (<tt>;</tt>) to the end of line 
    are considered as comment and are ignored. You may also need to
    quote the value using either double-quotes (<tt>"value"</tt>) or
    simple quotes (<tt>'value'</tt>) to preserve white-space or semi-colons.
    The option names are case-insensitive.
    
    The available configuration options may be divided into several
    categories:
    <p></p>
    <b>Colors</b><br>
    <dl>
      <dt><tt>BackgroundColor</tt></dt>

      <dt><tt>Font</tt></dt>
      <dd>
	Font used to display the text of attributes and also in
	several other places of GUI where the text of attributes is
	displayed or edited. There are two possible formats of values
	for this option:
	<ol>
	  <li>Standard X font-spec, with possible wildcards, e.g.:
	    <blockquote><tt>-*-helvetica-medium-r-normal-*-12-*-*-*-*-*-iso8859-2</tt></blockquote>
	  </li>
	  <li>Font attribute-oriented format, which is a 
	    comma-separated list of pairs of the form
	    <tt>font-attribute:value</tt>. The attributes are:
	    <tt>family, size, weight, slant, underline,
	      overstrike</tt>. Family is a font-family name like
	    <tt>Arial, Helvetica</tt> or <tt>Times New Roman</tt>.
	    Size is a number providing the font-size in points
	    (i.e. not pixels!). Possible values for <tt>bold</tt>
	    are <tt>normal</tt> and <tt>bold</tt>, possible
	    values for <tt>slant</tt> are <tt>roman</tt> and
	    <tt>italics</tt>. The <tt>underline</tt> and 
	    <tt>overstrike</tt> attributes take just boolean
	    values of <tt>1</tt> and <tt>0</tt>.
	    If a font, that would match the specified attributes 	    
	    exactly, is not found, the most similar font is used.
	    <br>
	    Example:
	    <blockquote><tt>Font = family:Arial,size:10,weight:bold</tt></blockquote>
	  </li>
	</ol>	
      </dd>      
      <dt><tt>VLineFont</tt></dt>
      <dd>

    <a name="commandline"></a><h2>Starting TrEd from command-line</h2>
    
    <p>
      If running TrEd from command-line you may use several
      command-line options and also give TrEd one or more files to
      open. Each file-name may be also appended number of tree to
      be displayed by TrEd when the file is opened.      
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>NOTE:</b> You may need to replace <tt>tred</tt> with
      <tt>perl tred</tt> in the following usage examples in Windows
      or UNIX, if you cannot set <tt>tred</tt> the execute permissions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The general usage is:      
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <tt>tred [-c <i>config-file</i>] [-m <i>macro-file</i>] [-l <i>file-list</i>] <i>file1</i>[##<i>N</i>|#<i>N</i>] [<i>file2</i>[##<i>N</i>|#<i>N</i>] [...]]</tt>
</blockquote>
    or
    <blockquote><tt>tred -u|-h</tt></blockquote>
    to obtain short instructions on usage (<tt>-u</tt>)
    or a brief help (<tt>-h</tt>).
    <p>
      The optional command-line parameters have the following meaning:
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt><tt>-m</tt></dt>
      <dd>This parameter may be used to force TrEd to use a different 
	macro file from that given in TrEd's configuration file.
      </dd>
      <dt><tt>-c</tt></dt>
      <dd>This parameter may be used to force TrEd to use 
	a certain configuration file.
      </dd>
      <dt><tt>-l</tt></dt>
      <dd>Use this parameter to pass a file-list to TrEd. Each
	file-name given in the file-list must be on a separate line.
	This feature may be particulary useful under Windows, where
	maximum length of the command-line is usually very limited.
      </dd>
      <dt><tt>-h</tt></dt>
      <dd>Prints a brief help and exits.</dd>
      <dt><tt>-u</tt></dt>
      <dd>Prints a short help on usage and exits.</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>
      All other arguments passed to TrEd on the command line
      are considered file-names to open. (TrEd actually opens only one
      file at a time, but user may go to the next/previous file
      using the <b>File->Next File</b> and
      <b>File->Previous File</b> menu commands.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Every file-name either on the command-line or in a file-list
      may be given a number suffix which makes TrEd open that file
      on that tree. There are two possible formats for the suffices:
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt><tt>#N</tt></dt>
      <dd>
	where <tt>N</tt> is a number possibly followed by one or more
	upper-case letters. In this case, <tt>#N</tt> TrEd searches
	and displays the first tree in the file
	the root of which is assigned "<tt>#N</tt>" as a value
	of the attribute "form" (this feature works only for
	FS-files of The Prague Dependency Treebank).
      </dd>
      <dt><tt>##N</tt></dt>
      <dd>
	where <tt>N</tt> is a number. This makes TrEd to display the <tt>N</tt>-th tree
	when the given file is opened.
      </dd>
    </dl>
