* Platform specific issues:
  
** Linux

** Microsoft Windows

** MacOS X

*** Macros with Alt+key shortcut do not work

Use Help->"Examine bindings" and press Alt. If you see [Mode_switch]
instead of [Alt_R] or [Alt], create a file named .xmodmap in your home
directory and add the following lines to it:

clear Mod1
keycode 66 = Alt_L
keycode 69 = Alt_R
add Mod1 = Alt_L
add Mod1 = Alt_R

Note: The problem is not in Tk or TrEd but in X11 on Mac OS X.
