This package has the ambition to be a simple and usable perl API for
manipulating the treebank files in the .fs format (which was designed by
Michal Kren and is the only format supported by his Windows application
GRAPH.EXE used to interractively edit treebank analytical or
tectogramatical trees). See also Dan Zeman's review of this format in czech
at

<P>
The Fslib package defines functions for parsing .fs files, extracting
headers, reading trees and representing them in memory using simple hash
structures, manipulate the values of node attributes (either ``directly''
or via <STRONG>Get</STRONG> and <STRONG>Set</STRONG> functions) and even modify the structure of the trees (via <STRONG>Cut</STRONG>, <STRONG>Paste</STRONG> and <STRONG>DeleteTree</STRONG> functions or ``directly'').

<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="USAGE">USAGE</A></H1>
<P>
There are many ways to benefit from this package, I note here the most
typical one. Assume, you want to read the .fs file from the STDIN (or
whatever), then make some changes either to the structure of the trees or
to the values of the attributes (or both) and write it again. (Maybe you
only want to examine the structure, find something of your interest and
write some output about it -- it's up to you). For this purpose you may use
the code similar to the one mentioned in SYNOPSIS of this document. Let's
see how to manage the appropriate tasks (also watch the example in SYNOPSIS
while reading):

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="PARSING_FS_FILES">PARSING FS FILES</A></H2>
<P>
First you should read the header of the .fs file using
<STRONG>ReadAttribs()</STRONG> function, passing it as parameters the reference to the input file
descriptor (like \*STDIN), reference to an array, that will contain the
list of attribute names positionaly ordered and storing its return value to
a hash. The returned hash will then have the attribute names as keys and
their type character definitions as values. (see ReadAttribs description
for detail).

<P>
Note, that no Read... function from this package performs any seeking, only
reads the file on. So, it's expected, that you are at the beggining of the
file when you call ReadAttribs, and that you have read the header before
you parse the trees.

<P>
Anyway, having the attribute definitions read you probbably want to
continue and parse the trees. This is done in two steps. First you call the <STRONG>ReadTree()</STRONG> function (passing it only a reference to the input file descriptor) to
obtain (on return) a scalar (string), containing a linear representation of
the next tree on input in the .fs format (except for line-breaks). You
should store it. Now you should test, that it was really a tree that was
read and not something else, which may be some environmetal or macro
definition for GRAPH.EXE which is allowed by .fs format. This may be done
simply by matching the result of <STRONG>ReadTree()</STRONG> with the pattern /^\[/ because trees and only trees begin with the square
bracket `['. If it is so, you may continue by parsing the tree with <STRONG>GetTree()</STRONG>. This function parses the linear .fs representation of the tree and
re-represents it as a structure of references to perl hashes (this I call a
tree node structure - TNS). For more about TNS's see chapter called
MODIFYING AND EXAMINING TREES and the REFERENCE item Tree Node Structure.
On return of <STRONG>GetTree()</STRONG> you get a reference to the tree's TNS. You may store it (by pushing it to
an array, i.e.) and continue by reading next tree, or do any other job on
it.

<P>
When you are finished with reading the trees and also had made all the
changes you wanted, you may want to write the trees back. This is done
using the <STRONG>PrintFS()</STRONG> function (see its description bellow). To create a corect .fs file, you
probably should write back the header before writing the trees, and also
write that messy environmetal stuff after the trees are written.

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="MODIFYING_OR_EXAMINING_TREES">MODIFYING OR EXAMINING TREES</A></H2>
<P>
TNS represents both a node and the whole subtree having root in this node.
So whole trees are represented by their roots. TNS is actualy just a
reference to a hash. The keys of the hashes may be either some of attribute
names or some `special' keys, serving to hold the tree structure. Suppose
<CODE>$node</CODE> is a TNS and `lemma' is an attribute defined in the
appropriate .fs file. Than $$node{``lemma''} is value of the attribute for
the node represented by TNS $node. You may obtain this value also as <STRONG>Get</STRONG>($node,``lemma''). From the <CODE>$node</CODE> TNS you may obtain also the
node's parent, sons and brothers (both left and right). This may be done in
several equivalent ways. TNS's of a nodes relatives are stored under values
of those `special' keys mentioned above. These keys are chosen in such a
way that they should not colide with attribute names and are stored in the
following scalar variables:

<UL>
<LI>
<P>
<CODE>$parent</CODE>

<LI>
<P>
<CODE>$firstson</CODE>

<LI>
<P>
<CODE>$lbrother</CODE>

<LI>
<P>
<CODE>$rbrother</CODE>

</UL>
<P>
(You may change these variables if you want, but note, that modifying them
once the trees are read may lead to problems:-)

<P>
So, to obtain $node's parent's TNS you may use either $$node{$parent} or <STRONG>Get</STRONG>($node,$parent) or even special function <STRONG>Parent</STRONG>($node). The same holds for the first son, left and right brothers while
you may also prefere to use the <STRONG>FirstSon()</STRONG>, <STRONG>LBrother()</STRONG> and
<STRONG>RBrother()</STRONG> functions respectively. If the node's relative (say first son) does not
exist, the value obtained in either of the mentioned ways <EM>is</EM> still <EM>defined but zero</EM>.

<P>
To create a new node, you usually create a new hash and call
<STRONG>NewNode()</STRONG> passing it a reference to the new hash as a parameter.

<P>
To modify a node's value for a certain attribute (say 'lemma'), you symply
type <CODE>$$node{&quot;lemma&quot;}=&quot;bar&quot;</CODE> (supposed you want the value to become 'bar') or use the <STRONG>Set()</STRONG> function like
<STRONG>Set</STRONG><CODE>($node,&quot;bar&quot;);</CODE>.

<P>
To modify the tree's structure, you may use <STRONG>Cut</STRONG> and <STRONG>Paste</STRONG>
function as described bellow or to delete a whole subtree you may use the <STRONG>DeleteTree</STRONG> function. This also frees memory used by the TNS. If you want to delete a
subtree of $node, but still keep its root, you may use a construct like:

<P>
<PRE>  DeleteTree(FirstSon($node)) while(FirstSon($node));
</PRE>
<P>
Note, that Cut function also deletes a subree from the tree but keeps the
TNS in memory and returns a reference to it.
