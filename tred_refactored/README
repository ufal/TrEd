About
-----

TrEd is a fully customizable and programmable graphical editor and
viewer for tree-like structures. Among other projects, it was used as
the main annotation tool for syntactical and tectogrammatical
annotations in the Prague Dependency Treebank, and for decision-tree
based morphological annotation of The Prague Arabic Dependency
Treebank.

TrEd runs on the following platforms:

    * Microsoft Windows
    * GNU Linux
    * Mac OS X
    * BSD, UNIX, Solaris and other POSIX/UNIX-like systems

Installation
------------

See http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/tred/

Configuration
-------------

When the first change to the configuration is made, TrEd tries to save
it to its default configuration path, usually tred/tredlib/tredrc. If
this file is not writable, ~/.tredrc is created and used henceforth.
This file may also by created manually by copying the default
configuration file (tredlib/tredrc).  Other locally installed files,
such as extensions and their configuration, is stored in a directory
~/.tred.d 

Note for Windows users: ~ is the "Application Data" folder under your
user profile.
