What is tred
------------

TrEd stands for "Tree Editor". It is a Perl/Tk-based graphical editor
of tree structures such as dependency trees. TrEd is the main
annotation tool used for analytical and tectogramatical treebanking
projects of The Prague Dependency Treebank. Due to its general nature,
TrEd may also find some other applications. TrEd may be extended by
writing user defined macros (using the Perl language - see
the documentation for more detail).

There is also a batch (off-line) variant of TrEd called btred -
"Batch-mode Tree Editor" - which allows you to run macros on trees
without having to use the graphical environment and a related tool
called "ntred" able to (almost) transparently paralelize btred
computing over a cluster of machines.

Requirements
------------

For the basic use, only Perl v5.6 or higher and Perl/Tk library
v800.025 or higher are required. Depending on the I/O format used,
some other Perl modules may be required, e.g. XML::LibXML and XML::Simple
for the XML based formats. TrEd may run on following platforms:

  Windows 95 up to Windows XP (with ActivePerl)
  Linux
  Possibly other platforms (such as MacOS X)

Please NOTE that this program is being developed and tested under
Linux and is also widely used on the Windows platform. From other
platforms, TrEd was reported to run fine under MacOS X (as an X11
client). We have no reports from users of other platforms.

Installation
------------

This topic is described in the INSTALL file.

Configuration
-------------

When the first change to the configuration is made, TrEd tries to save
it to its default configuration path, usually tred/tredlib/tredrc. If
this file is not writable, ~/.tredrc is created and used henceforth.
This file may also by created manually by copying the default
configuration file.
