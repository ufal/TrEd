What is tred
------------

Tred stands for "Tree Editor". It is a Perl/Tk-based graphical
editor for tree structures in the Fs format (for description see
http://ufal.ms.mff.cuni.cz/local/doc/trees/format_fs.html) used for
working with syntactical and tectogramatical trees in The Prague
Dependency Treebank. Because the format is a bit more general, this
program may also find some other applications. You may extend the editor
by writing your own macros (in Perl using functions functions defined
in tred.def standard definition file and functions defined in Fslib library
- see Fslib documentation for more detail).

There is also a batch (off-line) variant of Tred called btred -
"Batch-mode Tree Editor" - which allows you to run macros on trees
without having to use the graphical environment. See also examples
directory for few more scripts that may serve you in a similar way as
btred and may be simplier to use in some cases. 

What it requires
----------------

You only need perl5 with Perl/Tk ver. 800.015 library to run Tred.
This means that Tred may run on following platforms:

  Windows 9x,NT (download perl and perlTk from ActivePerl)
  Linux (with glibc2 = libc.6, otherwise you will probably 
         not be able to compile Perl/Tk)
  Possibly other platforms (other UN*X platforms as Perl5
         and perlTk should be abailable for them;
	 AFAIK there is perl5 and perlTk on MacOS too)

Please NOTE that this program was tested and developed under Linux, so
all other platform support is moreless experimental or even
theoretical.

	 
Installation
------------

This topic is described in the INSTALL file.


Also note that:
---------------
- .tredrc is your configuration file, it is text-based so that you may edit it 

- you may print either to file or using a command. In both cases Tred
generates postscript. On Windows desktop you will probably have to use
ghostview to print obtained file (unless you have installed st. like
lpr i.e. from cygwins).

- printing uses postscript font (arial by default) but expects it has
the same metrics as the display font

- you may define macros and bind them to keyboard events. This is done
preferably in tred.mac file, but you may use also tred.def which
should however contain moreless st. like preliminary definitions. Let
the files included with this distributions serve you as examples (the
macro language is perl, it is evaled directly form Tred, so you may
use its variables and functions - but be carefull!!). The active node
is pointed to by variable $this. To change active node simply assign
this variable. Root of the current tree is $root. You may (as in
Fslib.pm) change or refer to node's attribute values by either
  $$node{'atrname'}
or (by more readable but one-char longer)
  $node->{'atrname'} 
To access node's neighbours use Parent, FirstSon,
LBrother and RBrother functions.  To rearange nodes in the tree you
may use macros CutNode/Cut and PasteNode (Paste is more low-level and
you should *not* therfore use it).  Also, you may find useful macros
NextTree,PrevTree,GotoTree to move between trees and Next/Prev macros
to trace along the current tree.

For more info on macros see Fslib documentation (in
tredlib/documentation directory) - which is as well as the library
itself part of this distribution.

Note that there is a convertor called graph2tred which allows you port
your macros written for Michal Kren's editor Graph to Perl macros
which may be used by Tred withough any further modifications. For more
detail see README.grap2tred file in this distribution.
