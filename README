About
-----

TrEd is a fully customizable and programmable graphical editor and
viewer for tree-like structures. Among other projects, it was used as
the main annotation tool for syntactical and tectogrammatical
annotations in the Prague Dependency Treebank, and for decision-tree
based morphological annotation of The Prague Arabic Dependency
Treebank.

TrEd runs on the following platforms:

    * Windows 95/98/ME or Windows NT/2000/XP (TM)
    * Linux
    * BSD, OS X, UNIX, Solaris (TM) and other UNIX-based systems

Installation
------------

This topic is briefly described in the INSTALL file and in more detail
described in the User's Manual.

Configuration
-------------

When the first change to the configuration is made, TrEd tries to save
it to its default configuration path, usually tred/tredlib/tredrc. If
this file is not writable, ~/.tredrc is created and used henceforth.
This file may also by created manually by copying the default
configuration file (tredlib/tredrc).
