tkfs ver. 0.1 beta
==================
by Petr Pajas, 2000

You only need perl5 and working Perl/Tk to run tkfs.
This means that tkfs may run on following platforms:

  Windows 9x,NT (download perl and perlTk from ActivePerl)
  Linux (with glibc2 = libc.6, otherwise you will probably 
         not be able to run Perl/Tk:( )
  Possibly other platforms (other UN*X platforms as Perl5
         and perlTk should be abailable for them;
	 AFAIK there is perl5 and perlTk on MacOS too)


	 
Please make sure you have installed:
-------------------------------------

- Tkfs.pm into some directory of perl includes (theese you may 
set by PERLLIB or PERL5LIB variable)

- tkdisplaytree.pl (and optionaly tkfs as a link or copy/rename of it) to
your prefered bin directory

- make copy of tkfsrc named .tkfsrc in you home directory
(under Windows you may either set the HOME variable or
change its default location in tkdisplaytree.pl manually).

Also note that:
---------------
- .tkfsrc is your configuration file, it is text-based so that you may edit it 

- you may print either to file or using a command. In both cases
tkdisplaytree.fs (aka tkfs) generates postscript. On Windows desktop
you will probably have to use ghostview to print obtained file (unless
you have installed st. like lpr i.e. from cygwins).

- printing uses postscript font (arial by default) but expects it has
the same metrics as the display font

- you may define macros and bind them to keyboard events. This is done
preferably in tkfs.mac file, but you may use also tkfs.def which should
however contain moreless st. like preliminary definitions. Let the files
included with this distributions serve you as examples (the macro language
is perl, it is evaled directly form tkdisplaytree.pl, so you may use
its variables). The active node is pointed to by variable $this. To change
active node simply assign this variable. Root of the current tree is 
$root. You may (as in Fslib.pm)
change or refer to node's attribute values by either
  $$node{'atrname'}
or (by more readable but one-char longer)
  $node->{'atrname'}
To rearange nodes in the tree you may use macros CutNode/Cut and PasteNode
(Paste is more low-level and you should *not* therfore use it). 
Also, you may find useful macros NextTree,PrevTree,GotoTree to move
between trees and Next/Prev macros to trace along the current tree.

For more info on macros see Fslib man-page/documentation.
